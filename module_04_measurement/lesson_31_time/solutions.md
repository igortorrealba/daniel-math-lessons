---

## Section 7: Simple Elapsed Time (Within One Hour)

*When times are in the same hour, just subtract minutes*

31. **From 2:15 to 2:45** = **30 minutes**
    (45 - 15 = 30)

32. **From 6:20 to 6:55** = **35 minutes**
    (55 - 20 = 35)

33. **From 10:10 to 10:40** = **30 minutes**
    (40 - 10 = 30)

34. **From 4:05 to 4:35** = **30 minutes**
    (35 - 5 = 30)

35. **From 8:25 to 8:55** = **30 minutes**
    (55 - 25 = 30)

---

## Section 8: Elapsed Time (Crossing Hours)

39. **From 6:45 to 9:00** = **2 hours 15 minutes**
    - 6:45 to 7:00 = 15 minutes
    - 7:00 to 9:00 = 2 hours
    - Total = 2 hours 15 minutes

40. **From 2:30 to 6:00** = **3 hours 30 minutes**
    - 2:30 to 3:00 = 30 minutes
    - 3:00 to 6:00 = 3 hours
    - Total = 3 hours 30 minutes

---

## Section 9: Finding Ending Times

41. **Start 2:00, wait 3 hours** → **End at 5:00**

42. **Start 10:30, wait 2 hours** → **End at 12:30**

44. **Start 4:20, wait 2 hours 40 minutes** → **End at 7:00**
    - 4:20 + 2 hours = 6:20
    - 6:20 + 40 minutes = 7:00

45. **Start 9:15, wait 3 hours 45 minutes** → **End at 1:00**
    - 9:15 + 3 hours = 12:15
    - 12:15 + 45 minutes = 1:00

---

## Section 10: Finding Starting Times

    - 10:00 - 3 hours = 7:00
    - 7:00 - 30 minutes = 6:30

49. **Ends 6:15, lasted 2 hours 45 minutes** → **Started at 3:30**
    - 6:15 - 2 hours = 4:15
    - 4:15 - 45 minutes = 3:30

50. **Ends 8:45, lasted 1 hour 30 minutes** → **Started at 7:15**
    - 8:45 - 1 hour = 7:45
    - 7:45 - 30 minutes = 7:15
