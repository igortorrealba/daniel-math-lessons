# Lesson 31: Detailed Explanations

## Reading Analog Clocks

### Understanding the Clock Face

An analog clock is a circle divided into 12 equal sections, numbered 1 through 12.

```
         12
      11   1
   10        2
 9             3
   8         4
      7    5
         6
```

### The Hour Hand (Short Hand)

**What it does:**
- Points to the hour (the big numbers)
- Moves slowly
- Makes one complete rotation every 12 hours

**Reading it:**
```
If the short hand points to 3 → It's 3:00
If the short hand is between 3 and 4 → It's past 3 o'clock
If the short hand is almost at 4 → It's almost 4 o'clock
```

### The Minute Hand (Long Hand)

**What it does:**
- Points to the minutes (the small marks)
- Moves faster than the hour hand
- Makes one complete rotation every 60 minutes

**Reading it:**
```
Pointing to 12 → 0 minutes (or :00)
Pointing to 1  → 5 minutes (:05)
Pointing to 2  → 10 minutes (:10)
Pointing to 3  → 15 minutes (:15)
Pointing to 4  → 20 minutes (:20)
Pointing to 5  → 25 minutes (:25)
Pointing to 6  → 30 minutes (:30)
Pointing to 7  → 35 minutes (:35)
Pointing to 8  → 40 minutes (:40)
Pointing to 9  → 45 minutes (:45)
Pointing to 10 → 50 minutes (:50)
Pointing to 11 → 55 minutes (:55)
```

**Easy trick:**
Each number on the clock represents 5 minutes!

### Reading Time on an Analog Clock

**Example 1: 3:15**
```
Hour hand: points to 3
Minute hand: points to 3 (which is 15 minutes)

Time: 3:15 (three fifteen)
Said aloud: "Three fifteen" or "Quarter past three"
```

**Example 2: 7:30**
```
Hour hand: between 7 and 8 (because 30 minutes have passed)
Minute hand: points to 6 (which is 30 minutes)

Time: 7:30 (seven thirty)
Said aloud: "Seven thirty" or "Half past seven"
```

**Example 3: 9:45**
```
Hour hand: almost at 10 (almost 10 o'clock)
Minute hand: points to 9 (which is 45 minutes)

Time: 9:45 (nine forty-five)
Said aloud: "Nine forty-five" or "Quarter to ten"
```

## Special Times on a Clock

### Telling Time with "Quarter" and "Half"

**Quarter Past (15 minutes)**
```
3:15 = Quarter past 3
     = 3 and 15 minutes
     = 15 minutes after 3 o'clock
```

**Half Past (30 minutes)**
```
4:30 = Half past 4
     = 4 and 30 minutes
     = 30 minutes after 4 o'clock
```

**Quarter To (45 minutes)**
```
5:45 = Quarter to 6
     = 45 minutes after 5 o'clock
     = 15 minutes before 6 o'clock
```

## Reading Digital Clocks

### Format Understanding

Digital clocks show time as: **HH:MM**

Where:
- **HH** = hours (00-23 for 24-hour time, or 1-12 for 12-hour time)
- **MM** = minutes (00-59)
- **:** = the colon separator

### 12-Hour Format (with A.M./P.M.)

**Morning times:**
```
6:00 AM = Six in the morning
8:30 AM = Eight thirty in the morning
11:45 AM = Eleven forty-five in the morning
12:00 PM = Noon
```

**Afternoon/Evening times:**
```
12:00 PM = Noon
1:15 PM = One fifteen in the afternoon
6:45 PM = Six forty-five in the evening
10:30 PM = Ten thirty at night
```

**Midnight:**
```
12:00 AM = Midnight (start of the day)
12:30 AM = Thirty minutes after midnight
```

**Conversions:**
```
A.M. times (morning): 12:00 AM to 11:59 AM
P.M. times (afternoon/night): 12:00 PM to 11:59 PM
```

### 24-Hour Format (Military Time)

Some clocks show time as 00:00 to 23:59

**Conversion:**
```
12:00 AM = 00:00 (midnight)
1:00 AM = 01:00
6:00 AM = 06:00
12:00 PM = 12:00 (noon)
1:00 PM = 13:00
6:00 PM = 18:00
11:00 PM = 23:00
```

## Converting Between Time Units

### Minutes to Seconds
**Multiply by 60: 1 minute = 60 seconds**

```
Example 1: 5 minutes = 5 × 60 = 300 seconds
Example 2: 3 minutes = 3 × 60 = 180 seconds
```

### Seconds to Minutes
**Divide by 60: 60 seconds = 1 minute**

```
Example 1: 180 seconds = 180 ÷ 60 = 3 minutes
Example 2: 420 seconds = 420 ÷ 60 = 7 minutes
```

### Minutes to Hours
**Divide by 60: 60 minutes = 1 hour**

```
Example 1: 120 minutes = 120 ÷ 60 = 2 hours
Example 2: 180 minutes = 180 ÷ 60 = 3 hours
```

### Hours to Minutes
**Multiply by 60: 1 hour = 60 minutes**

```
Example 1: 2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes
Example 2: 5 hours = 5 × 60 = 300 minutes
```

## Calculating Elapsed Time

**Elapsed time** is how much time passes from a starting time to an ending time.

### Method 1: Counting On (Easy for Small Intervals)

**Problem: What time is it if 20 minutes pass after 3:45?**

```
Start time: 3:45

Count on by 5s:
3:45 → 3:50 (5 minutes)
3:50 → 3:55 (10 minutes)
3:55 → 4:00 (15 minutes)
4:00 → 4:05 (20 minutes)

Answer: 4:05
```

### Method 2: Subtraction (For Different Hours)

**Problem: How much time passes from 2:30 PM to 5:00 PM?**

```
Start: 2:30 PM
End: 5:00 PM

Step 1: Count to the next hour
2:30 to 3:00 = 30 minutes

Step 2: Count hours
3:00 to 5:00 = 2 hours

Step 3: Add them
30 minutes + 2 hours = 2 hours 30 minutes

Answer: 2 hours 30 minutes (or 2.5 hours)
```

### Method 3: Break It Down

**Problem: How much time passes from 8:15 AM to 11:45 AM?**

```
Start: 8:15 AM
End: 11:45 AM

Step 1: Find minutes to next hour
8:15 to 9:00 = 45 minutes

Step 2: Count full hours
9:00 to 11:00 = 2 hours

Step 3: Count remaining minutes
11:00 to 11:45 = 45 minutes

Step 4: Add them up
45 min + 2 hours + 45 min = 3 hours 30 minutes

Answer: 3 hours 30 minutes
```

## Word Problems About Time

### Problem Type 1: Find the Ending Time

**Problem: School starts at 8:30 AM and lasts 6 hours. When does it end?**

```
Start: 8:30 AM
Duration: 6 hours

Count forward:
8:30 + 6 hours = 2:30 PM

Answer: 2:30 PM (or 14:30 in 24-hour format)
```

### Problem Type 2: Find the Elapsed Time

**Problem: You start homework at 4:15 PM and finish at 5:45 PM. How long did it take?**

```
Start: 4:15 PM
End: 5:45 PM

Method: 4:15 to 5:15 = 1 hour
        5:15 to 5:45 = 30 minutes

Total: 1 hour 30 minutes
```

### Problem Type 3: Find the Starting Time

**Problem: Daniel finishes his game at 7:30 PM. The game lasted 90 minutes. When did it start?**

```
End: 7:30 PM
Duration: 90 minutes = 1 hour 30 minutes

Count backward:
7:30 PM - 1 hour 30 minutes = 6:00 PM

Answer: 6:00 PM
```

## Common Time Expressions

### Quarter (15 minutes)
- 3:15 = Quarter past 3 (or quarter after 3)
- 3:45 = Quarter to 4 (or quarter before 4)

### Half (30 minutes)
- 3:30 = Half past 3 (or half after 3)

### O'Clock (Exactly on the hour)
- 3:00 = Three o'clock

## Summary

- **Analog clock**: Read the hour hand (short) and minute hand (long)

- **60 seconds** = 1 minute
- **60 minutes** = 1 hour
- **24 hours** = 1 day
- **Elapsed time** = End time minus start time
