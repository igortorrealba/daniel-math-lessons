## Section 11: Ordering and Problems

**61. Order from smallest to largest: 3 m, 300 mm, 30 cm, 0.3 km**

First, convert all to the same unit (meters):
- 3 m = 3 m
- 300 mm = 0.3 m
- 30 cm = 0.3 m
- 0.3 km = 300 m

Answer: **300 mm, 30 cm, 3 m, 0.3 km**
Or: **0.3 m, 0.3 m, 3 m, 300 m**

---

**62. Order from smallest to largest: 5 km, 5 m, 5 cm, 5 mm**

Answer: **5 mm, 5 cm, 5 m, 5 km**

*(The same number in smaller units is always a smaller distance!)*

---

**63. Order from smallest to largest: 1.5 m, 150 cm, 1500 mm, 0.0015 km**

Convert all to meters:
- 1.5 m = 1.5 m
- 150 cm = 1.5 m
- 1500 mm = 1.5 m
- 0.0015 km = 1.5 m

Answer: **They're all equal!**
Or: **1.5 m = 150 cm = 1500 mm = 0.0015 km**
