# Lesson 29: Length and Distance

## Core Concepts

### What is Length?
Length is how long something is, measured from one end to the other.

**Examples:**
- How tall you are
- The length of a table
- The distance between two cities
- The size of your hand

### Metric Units of Length

The **metric system** uses units that are easy to convert because they go by 10s!

#### The Four Main Units

1. **Millimeter (mm)**
   - The smallest unit we usually use
   - About the thickness of a credit card
   - Used for: Small objects, precision measurements

2. **Centimeter (cm)**
   - About the width of your pointer finger
   - 10 millimeters = 1 centimeter
   - Used for: Small to medium objects, height of children

3. **Meter (m)**
   - About the length of a baseball bat
   - 100 centimeters = 1 meter
   - Used for: Room sizes, heights of buildings, distances in sports

4. **Kilometer (km)**
   - About 1000 meters
   - A very long distance
   - Used for: Distance between cities, long road trips

### Conversion Chart

```
1 cm = 10 mm
1 m = 100 cm
1 m = 1,000 mm
1 km = 1,000 m
```

**Memory trick:** Each step is 10 times bigger!

### Choosing the Right Unit

- **Millimeters**: Width of a pencil lead, thickness of a coin
- **Centimeters**: Length of a pencil, width of a hand, height of a young child
- **Meters**: Height of a person, length of a car, width of a room
- **Kilometers**: Distance to school, distance between cities

## Key Vocabulary

- **Length**: How long something is
- **Distance**: How far apart two things are
- **Measurement**: Finding the size or amount of something
- **Unit**: A standard measurement (mm, cm, m, km)
- **Convert**: Change from one unit to another

## Why the Metric System?

The metric system is used in almost every country in the world (except the USA!) because:
- It's based on 10 (easier to work with)
- It's logical and consistent
- It's used in science and medicine everywhere
