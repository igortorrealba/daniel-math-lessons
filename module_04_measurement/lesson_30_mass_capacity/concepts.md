# Lesson 30: Mass and Capacity

## Core Concepts

### What is Mass?
**Mass** is the amount of "stuff" (matter) in something. It measures how heavy something is.

**Examples:**
- Weight of a book
- Weight of a person
- Weight of food

### What is Capacity?
**Capacity** is how much something can hold. It measures volume (the space inside a container).

**Examples:**
- How much water a bottle can hold
- How much milk fits in a glass
- How much juice in a carton

## Units of Mass (Weight)

### Gram (g)
- The basic unit of mass
- About the weight of a marble
- Used for: Small objects, ingredients in cooking

**Visual examples:**
- Paper clip: about 1 gram
- Marble: about 6-7 grams
- Apple: about 100 grams
- Chocolate bar: about 50 grams

### Kilogram (kg)
- 1000 grams = 1 kilogram
- About the weight of a large textbook
- Used for: People, larger objects, groceries

**Visual examples:**
- Human adult: 50-100 kg
- 10-year-old child: 25-40 kg
- A liter of water: 1 kg
- A bag of flour: 1 kg

### Quick Conversion
```
1 kg = 1000 g

Examples:
3 kg = 3 × 1000 = 3000 g
5000 g = 5000 ÷ 1000 = 5 kg
```

## Units of Capacity (Volume)

### Milliliter (mL)
- The smallest capacity unit we use
- About 20 drops of water
- Used for: Medicine, small amounts of liquid, cooking

**Visual examples:**
- One teaspoon ≈ 5 mL
- One tablespoon ≈ 15 mL
- Medicine dose: 5-10 mL
- A small cup of juice: 200 mL

### Liter (L)
- 1000 milliliters = 1 liter
- About the size of a large milk carton
- Used for: Bottles, containers, recipes, fuel

**Visual examples:**
- Large water bottle: 1.5 liters
- Milk carton: 1 liter
- Gasoline tank: 40-60 liters
- Large cooking pot: 5-10 liters

### Quick Conversion
```
1 L = 1000 mL

Examples:
2 L = 2 × 1000 = 2000 mL
3500 mL = 3500 ÷ 1000 = 3.5 L
```

## Key Relationship
**1 kilogram of water = 1 liter**

This is a special relationship in the metric system:
- 1 kg of water takes up 1 liter of space
- This makes conversions easier in science and cooking

## Key Vocabulary

- **Mass**: How much something weighs
- **Gram (g)**: A small unit of mass
- **Kilogram (kg)**: 1000 grams
- **Capacity**: How much a container can hold
- **Milliliter (mL)**: A small unit of capacity
- **Liter (L)**: 1000 milliliters
- **Scale**: A tool for measuring mass
- **Measuring cup**: A tool for measuring capacity

## Common Tools for Measurement

### Kitchen Scale
- Measures mass in grams or kilograms
- Used for cooking, baking, and weighing food

### Measuring Cup
- Measures capacity in milliliters or liters
- Used in cooking and recipes

### Measuring Spoons
- Small teaspoons and tablespoons
- Used for small amounts in cooking

### Bathroom Scale
- Measures human body weight in kilograms or pounds
