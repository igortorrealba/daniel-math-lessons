# Lesson 28: Detailed Explanations

## Understanding Decimal Word Problems

### Money Problems 💰

#### Simple Addition
**Problem:** Maria has $3.50. Her friend gives her $2.25. How much money does Maria have now?

```
Step 1: Identify what we know
   - Maria starts with $3.50
   - She gets $2.25 more
   - We need to find the total

Step 2: Choose operation → ADDITION

Step 3: Estimate first
   - $3.50 is about $4
   - $2.25 is about $2
   - $4 + $2 = $6 (estimate)

Step 4: Set up and solve
     $3.50
   + $2.25
   -------
     $5.75

Step 5: Check
   - Our estimate was $6
   - Our answer $5.75 is close to $6 ✓
   - Makes sense!
```

**Answer: Maria has $5.75**

#### Subtraction and Change
**Problem:** Daniel has $10.00. He buys a book that costs $7.45. How much change does he get?

```
Step 1: Identify what we know
   - Daniel has $10.00
   - Book costs $7.45
   - We need to find the leftover money

Step 2: Choose operation → SUBTRACTION

Step 3: Estimate first
   - $10.00 is about $10
   - $7.45 is about $7
   - $10 - $7 = $3 (estimate)

Step 4: Set up and solve
     $10.00
   -  $7.45
   --------
      $2.55

Step 5: Check
   - Our estimate was $3
   - Our answer $2.55 is close to $3 ✓
   - Makes sense!
```

**Answer: Daniel gets $2.55 in change**

### Measurement Problems 📏

#### Adding Lengths
**Problem:** A ribbon is 2.3 meters long. Another ribbon is 1.6 meters long. What is the total length of both ribbons?

```
Step 1: What do we know?
   - First ribbon = 2.3 m
   - Second ribbon = 1.6 m
   - Find the total

Step 2: Operation → ADDITION

Step 3: Estimate
   - 2.3 is about 2
   - 1.6 is about 2
   - 2 + 2 = 4 (estimate)

Step 4: Solve
     2.3 m
   + 1.6 m
   -------
     3.9 m

Step 5: Check
   - Estimate was 4
   - Answer 3.9 is close ✓
```

**Answer: Total length is 3.9 meters**

#### Comparing Measurements
**Problem:** A rope is 5.8 meters long. We cut off 2.3 meters. How much rope is left?

```
Step 1: What do we know?
   - Original rope = 5.8 m
   - Cut off = 2.3 m
   - Find what's left

Step 2: Operation → SUBTRACTION

Step 3: Estimate
   - 5.8 is about 6
   - 2.3 is about 2
   - 6 - 2 = 4 (estimate)

Step 4: Solve
     5.8 m
   - 2.3 m
   -------
     3.5 m

Step 5: Check
   - Estimate was 4
   - Answer 3.5 is close ✓
```

**Answer: 3.5 meters of rope is left**

## Multi-Step Problems

**Problem:** Emma buys two items:
- A pencil costs $1.25
- An eraser costs $0.75

She pays with a $5.00 bill. How much change does she get?

```
Step 1: Understand the problem
   - Need to find total spent
   - Then find the change

Step 2: FIRST - Add the costs
     $1.25
   + $0.75
   -------
     $2.00 (total spent)

Step 3: THEN - Subtract from payment
     $5.00
   - $2.00
   -------
     $3.00 (change)

Step 4: Estimate to check
   - $1.25 + $0.75 ≈ $1 + $1 = $2 ✓
   - $5 - $2 = $3 ✓
   - Our answer matches the estimate!
```

**Answer: Emma gets $3.00 in change**

## Estimation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Rounding to Whole Numbers

**Use when:** You want a quick, rough answer

```
Example Problem:
Tom has $8.60 and buys something for $3.45.
About how much will he have left?

Round to whole numbers:
   $8.60 → $9
   $3.45 → $3
   $9 - $3 = $6 (estimate)

Exact answer:
   $8.60 - $3.45 = $5.15

The estimate tells us the answer is close to $6,
and the exact answer $5.15 makes sense!
```

### Strategy 2: Rounding to Tenths

**Use when:** You want a more precise estimate

```
Example Problem:
A container holds 2.47 liters.
Another holds 1.35 liters.
About how much total?

Round to tenths:
   2.47 → 2.5
   1.35 → 1.4
   2.5 + 1.4 = 3.9 (estimate)

Exact answer:
   2.47 + 1.35 = 3.82

The estimate 3.9 is very close to 3.82!
```

### Strategy 3: Compensating

**Use when:** One number is very close to a round number

```
Example Problem:
7.98 + 3.25 = ?

Notice: 7.98 is almost 8!

Think: If I round 7.98 to 8:
   8 + 3.25 = 11.25

But I added 0.02 too much, so:
   11.25 - 0.02 = 11.23

Exact answer:
   7.98 + 3.25 = 11.23 ✓

(Much easier than calculating with 7.98!)
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Not Lining Up Decimal Points
```
Wrong:  $5.25           Right:  $5.25
      + $2.1                  + $2.10
      -------                 -------
      $5.46 ❌               $7.35 ✓
```

### Mistake 2: Forgetting to Check Reasonableness
```
Problem: $10.00 - $3.50 = ?

If you get $6.50, stop and ask:
"Does $6.50 make sense?"
Yes! It's less than $10 but more than $3. ✓

If you got $13.50, stop and ask:
"Does $13.50 make sense?"
No! I started with only $10. ❌
```

### Mistake 3: Not Reading the Question Carefully
```
Problem: "Maria has $5.00. She buys a book
for $2.50 and a pen for $1.75.
How much change does she have?"

Wrong thinking: 5.00 + 2.50 + 1.75 = ?
Right thinking: 5.00 - (2.50 + 1.75) = ?
               or: (5.00 - 2.50) - 1.75 = ?
```

## Practice Problem Format

**Each problem should include:**
1. The situation (context)
2. What you know (the numbers)
3. What you need to find (the question)

**Your solution should show:**
1. Your estimate
2. Your calculation
