# Lesson 27: Detailed Explanations

## Understanding Fractions and Decimals

### Story Time! 🍕
Imagine you have a pizza cut into 10 equal slices. If you eat 3 slices, you've eaten:
- **Fraction way**: 3/10 of the pizza
- **Decimal way**: 0.3 of the pizza

Both mean the SAME thing! They're just different ways to write it.

### Converting Fractions with Denominator 10 to Decimals

**Rule**: The numerator becomes the decimal place!

#### Example 1: 4/10
```
4/10 = 0.4

Why? Because we have 4 out of 10 parts
     = 4 tenths
     = 0.4
```

#### Example 2: 7/10
```
7/10 = 0.7

We have 7 out of 10 parts
     = 7 tenths
     = 0.7
```

#### Example 3: 10/10
```
10/10 = 1.0

We have all 10 parts
     = 10 tenths
     = one whole
     = 1.0
```

### Converting Fractions with Denominator 100 to Decimals

**Rule**: The numerator becomes the last two decimal places!

#### Example 1: 25/100
```
25/100 = 0.25

Why? Because we have 25 out of 100 parts
     = 25 hundredths
     = 0.25 (the 2 is in the tenths place, the 5 is in the hundredths place)
```

#### Example 2: 7/100
```
7/100 = 0.07

We have 7 out of 100 parts
     = 7 hundredths
     = 0.07 (notice the zero! it shows we have no tenths)
```

#### Example 3: 50/100
```
50/100 = 0.50

We have 50 out of 100 parts
     = 50 hundredths
     = 0.50 (same as 0.5)
```

### Converting Decimals to Fractions

**Reverse Process**: Read the decimal, then write it as a fraction!

#### Example 1: 0.6
```
Step 1: Read it → "six tenths"
Step 2: Write it → 6/10

Answer: 0.6 = 6/10 (can simplify to 3/5)
```

#### Example 2: 0.35
```
Step 1: Read it → "thirty-five hundredths"
Step 2: Write it → 35/100

Answer: 0.35 = 35/100 (can simplify to 7/20)
```

#### Example 3: 0.09
```
Step 1: Read it → "nine hundredths"
Step 2: Write it → 9/100

Answer: 0.09 = 9/100
```

### Visual Models Explained

#### Number Line Model
```
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
0      0.2     0.4     0.6     0.8     1.0
0/10   2/10    4/10    6/10    8/10    10/10
```
This shows how fractions and decimals line up on the same line!

#### Grid Model (Tenths)
```
We have 10 columns:
[X][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] = 0.1 (1/10 shaded)
[X][X][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] = 0.2 (2/10 shaded)
[X][X][X][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] = 0.3 (3/10 shaded)
```

#### Grid Model (Hundredths)
```
10×10 grid = 100 squares total
If 25 squares are shaded:
[████████]
[████████] = 0.25 = 25/100
[████    ]
```

### Comparing Decimals

#### Using the Same Decimal Places
**Rule**: Line up the decimal points!

```
Compare: 0.3 and 0.25

Step 1: Line them up
        0.30
        0.25

Step 2: Compare → 0.30 > 0.25
        (30 hundredths > 25 hundredths)
```

#### Using the Number Line
Put the numbers on a number line. The number further right is bigger!

```
    0.25        0.3
    |           |
0  ├───┼─────┼───┤  1
       ↑
   0.3 is further right, so 0.3 > 0.25
```

## Real-World Applications 💰

### Money Example
```
If you have $3.25:
- Decimal way: 3 dollars and 25 cents
- Fraction way: 3 and 25/100 dollars

The decimal makes it SO easy to count money!
```

### Measurement Example
```
If something measures 1.5 meters:
- Decimal way: 1 and 5/10 meters
- Fraction way: 1 and 5/10 meters

Both tell us it's 1 meter and half of another meter.
```

## Summary
- Fractions and decimals show the SAME value, just written differently
- With denominator 10: fraction numerator = tenths decimal place
- With denominator 100: fraction numerator = hundredths decimal places
- Decimals make comparisons and real-world applications easier!
