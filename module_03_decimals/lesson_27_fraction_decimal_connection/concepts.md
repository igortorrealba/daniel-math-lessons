# Lesson 27: Fraction and Decimal Connection

## Core Concepts

### What are Decimals?
Decimals are another way to show parts of a whole number. They use a **decimal point** (.) to separate the whole number from the fractional part.

### Key Terms
- **Decimal point**: The dot that separates whole numbers from decimal parts
- **Decimal places**: The digits after the decimal point
- **Tenth**: 1 out of 10 equal parts (0.1)
- **Hundredth**: 1 out of 100 equal parts (0.01)

### Connection Between Fractions and Decimals

#### Tenths (Denominator 10)
- 1/10 = 0.1 (one tenth)
- 3/10 = 0.3 (three tenths)
- 7/10 = 0.7 (seven tenths)
- 10/10 = 1.0 (ten tenths = one whole)

#### Hundredths (Denominator 100)
- 1/100 = 0.01 (one hundredth)
- 25/100 = 0.25 (twenty-five hundredths)
- 50/100 = 0.50 (fifty hundredths)
- 100/100 = 1.00 (one hundred hundredths = one whole)

### How to Read Decimals

#### Reading Tenths
- 0.3 → "three tenths" or "zero point three"
- 0.8 → "eight tenths" or "zero point eight"

#### Reading Hundredths
- 0.45 → "forty-five hundredths" or "zero point four five"
- 0.07 → "seven hundredths" or "zero point zero seven"

### Visual Models

#### Number Line
A number line shows where decimals sit between whole numbers.
- From 0 to 1, we can mark 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ... 0.9
- Between 0.3 and 0.4, we can show 0.31, 0.32, ... 0.39

#### Grid Models
- For tenths: A grid divided into 10 equal columns
- For hundredths: A 10×10 grid with 100 equal squares

#### Base-10 Blocks
- Long = 1 tenth (0.1)
- Small cube = 1 hundredth (0.01)
- Flat = 1 whole (1.00)

## Why This Matters
Decimals make it easier to:
- Work with money (dollars and cents)
- Take measurements
- Compare numbers easily
- Do calculations quickly
